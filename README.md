This next part, ` How EJ is a Genius, ---> what he accomplished in the previous class.`


```matlab
% Exercise 3.1 Vector matrix creation
% Num 1 to  4
myRowVec = [10 8 6 4 2];
% alternative myRowVec = 10:-2:0;  % This creates: 10 8 6 4 2 0
myColVec = [2;5;8;11];
matrixA = [5 5 5;5 5 5;5 5 5];
%matrixA = 5 * ones(3,3);  % ones(3,3) is a 3x3 matrix of 1s. Multiply by 5 to get 5s.
matrixB = randi([1 10], 2,4);
%Exercise 3.2 Type checking and Conversion
%Number 1, 
num_val=17.7;
class(num_val)
%Number 2
int_val=int8(num_val);
class(int_val)

% Number 3
isPositive=(num_val>0);
class (isPositive)

%Exercise 3.3 Arithmetic Expressions
%Number 1
x = sqrt(713)/(1+(3^7)) + 15/4 *7/15 ;
disp (x);
%Number 2
x=pi;
y=2;
a=nthroot(x*exp(y)+(sin(x)*tan(y)),3);
a
% Exercise 3.4
%Number 1
v1=2:2:10;
v2=v1/2 +1;
%Number 2
m1=[1 2;3 4];
m2=[5 6;7 8];
M_prod=m1*m2
M_elem_prod=m1.*m2
%Number 3
sec_row=M_prod(2,:)
%Number 4
M_elem_prod(1,2)= 0
